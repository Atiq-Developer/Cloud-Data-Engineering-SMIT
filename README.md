# Cloud-Data-Engineering-SMIT
In this repo I share my Cloud Data Engineering journey with SMIT under Sir Qasim Hassan â€” covering Python, Git, SQL, Snowflake, Kafka, Airflow &amp; AWS (S3, Lambda, EC2, Glue, QuickSight, Docker, VPC). Organized by stack with notes, code &amp; projects to build real-world data pipelines &amp; cloud solutions.
